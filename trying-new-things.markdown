WordPress is good, but boring. Drupal, Joomla and the other Content Management Systems (CMS) have been deleted after having time wasted on them. Site leaf, I expect, will be better in all of these regards. Yes, we've all been hurt by bad CMSs but there is one out there for the VANgrd Crew, hopefully.
